# seismic-detector

## Origin Story
Our team of **Seismic Detectives** was formed in response to the [NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/nasa-space-apps-2024/) call to work on challenges in a 2 day hackathon. 
The Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawaii in Honolulu sponsored the local event that resulted in our team being formed.
